# Land Battle Chess

### Platform:
Windows

### Built With:
Java, Object Oriented Programming Model

### Start to End Date:
November 2014 - March 2015

### Project Goal: 
To computerize a 2 player version of the chinese board game "Luzhanqi" (land battle chess) that is fully functional and adopts the original game rules.

### Description:
A description of the game can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luzhanqi). This project uses the Java Swing class to display the game board and accepts console input to select pieces on the board. An added feature of the product is the ability to undo turns up to the start of the game, to allow players to develop and rethink strategies. This feature is achieved with the use of stacks implemented with linked lists. Exception handling was also implemented for run-time errors with user input. The development procedure is documented (including planning, timeline, programming techniques, video presentation and evaluation). Documentation of code was done in Oracle standards with Javadoc.
